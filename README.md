This is the final documentation for my web application for Shooters Saloon & Eatery


PROJECT NAME: Shooters Saloon & Eatery

DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this project was to build a responsive web application for the course, Fundamentals of Mobile Web Application Development. Throughout the course, we were taught different fundamentals including wireframing web pages, creating navigation components and using Google Chrome DevTools. All of these concepts will be useful for any future career in web application development. My web application is about a local restaurant that I frequent called Shooters Saloon & Eatery. It is a one-of-a kind restaurant that gives anyone who visits a hometown feel. 

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Creating a virtual machine via Microsoft Azure and developing the proper connections to build and upload the code to the web page including Putty and Filezilla.
2. Illustrating wireframes of each web page to determine how the layout and navigation components should appear on the web page.
3. Taking sample code provided by the instructor and manipulating it with your own information and formatting. 
4. Testing and previewing code created to ensure it is working properly. 
5. Uploading the code to GitHub Desktop and creating versions to show the different changes in the code. 
6. Using Google Chrome DevTools to test changes you can make to code without actually changing your code. 
7. Submitting the Github URL and Webpage URL for grading and feedback. 
8. Building a README.md file to create final documentation about the web application.

USAGE: The web application was created to show people what Shooter's Saloon & Eatery is all about. It gives the user a glance of what is on the menu, the different types of events they have, and the different types of specials they have. The website should be used to give the user an idea of what the restaurant is all about. The application should be easy to use and interesting enough that someone will want to visit the restaurant in person.

CREDITS: The author of this web application is Casey Mason. Another author to include is Rasmussen School of Technology as they provided the framework to create the web application.
